**Work**: I have been working since 2007 in various roles as a Statistician, Data Analyst, Business Intelligence Project Manager and Data Scientist. I have a talent to provide organizations with greater opportunities to answer complex questions through a data-driven approach. Wide-ranging experience with problem solving, especially within the mobile phone industry and in the Customer Services and Quality Management related areas. I have worked in many crossfunctional teams with everything from development and implementation of forecasting methods in the warranty claim area, to experimental design, statistical analysis and reporting of A/B experiments, as well as holding an educational program about working with data according to the cross-industry standard for data mining ([CSISP-DM]). Other fun projects include, for example, development of technologies for early detection of quality problems, and managing development and deployment of multidimensional OLAP cube projects such as to optimize aftermarket supply chain management as well as lead time investigation in the global service center repair structure. Check out my [LinkedIn] profile for more info.


*Key skills*: 
• Statistics and analytical skills - extensive knowledge, both formal and through work experience. For example within forecasting, prediction, machine learning, A/B-testing, econometrics, exploratory data analysis, data mining, big data and data visualization.

• R programming - more than 10k hours of coding in one of the main programming languages for data analysis.

• SQL programming - many years of experience with SQL databases in a global, fast-paced environment.

• Data-driven development - extensive experience with, for example, the Cross-Industry Standard for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) way of working.

• Quality Management - long experience within the mobile phone industry with quality control/improvement/assurance.

• Customer Services - comprehensive knowledge from a global customer services organization, with focus on increasing customer satisfaction and minimizing costs in the whole service center network.

• Project management skills - experience as a project manager in development of data analysis tools.

I’m driven by curiosity and my willingness to learn new things. I have developed my analytical skills and solution-oriented approach through intense practice. Told by others to be excellent at explaining difficult things in an easy manner, and to be helpful, friendly and trustworthy, as well as treating people with respect.

I'm aiming at expanding my role as a senior Data Analyst/Data Scientist. I’m interested in working with both data analytics that supports an organization to take the right decisions, and in development of end consumer facing products/services where data analytics expertise is needed.

**Education**: Master of Science (M.Sc) in Statistics from Lund University.

**Hobbies**: I have a great interest in history and psychology, to understand the present and where we are going, with eg. Artificial Intelligence. I really like to try out new stuff in [R] for fun on my spare time and I have developed some [Shiny] apps during the years. From statistics about the swedish elit soccer league, Allsvenskan, to election polls as well as very important apps such as 'dogdrinkr' to catch anomalies in the daily water intake of dogs! I activate myself through bouldering, strength & conditioning, yoga and occasionally wave surfing, discgolf and cycling. Cooking followed by a dinner party and interesting discussions around the table is also close to my heart.
